# K-Calc
### A 3D calculator from the future for all your computation needs.

This is a calculator that uses pure JavaScript for computation and memory. As soon as you hover over the calculator (or tap on it if on mobile), you experience a bit of fun 3D delight as it rotates in before you need to get to the number crunching.

User can:

* Add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers
* Clear the input field with a clear button
* Keep chaining mathematical operations together until the equal button is hit, and the calculator will display the correct output

Tech Highlights:

* Used **CSS 3D transforms** for the rotation action
